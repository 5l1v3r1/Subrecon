DNS Wordlist and Discovery tool

### DNS Discovery Tool
Currently under development.

### DNS Wordlist
There are multiple wordlists for all purposes.

The idea is to create several wordlists that they can be used on a case-by-case basis. For example, an Australian-specific subdomain wordlist for Aussie websites vs. Government-specific subdomain wordlist for Government websites.

#### wordlist-10000
A general wordlist with no specific focus.

#### wordlist-brian
A wordlist focusing on more common subdomain names.
