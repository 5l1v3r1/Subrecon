# DNS-Recon
DNS-Recon is a subdomain discovery tool with example wordlists.

### Subdomain Discovery Tool
Tool to return a list of subdomains found via. DNS brute forcing.

Currently under development.

#### Usage

`$ sh dns-recon.sh [ example.com ] [ wordlist_file.txt ]`

### Subdomain Wordlists
There are multiple wordlists for all purposes.

The idea is to create several wordlists that they can be used on a case-by-case basis. For example, an Australian-specific subdomain wordlist for Aussie websites vs. Government-specific subdomain wordlist for Government websites.

#### wordlist-10000
A general wordlist with no specific focus.

#### wordlist-brian
A wordlist focusing on more common subdomain names.
